# DualTouch

This project has a long story which I'm not interested to talk about what it was for but it took me almost 5 months to complete, It's one of my first electron and react projects and I also did the design and etc.

The 4 c# projects on my github are libraries that I had to create for this project:

https://github.com/MainSilent/Control

https://github.com/MainSilent/Taskbar

https://github.com/MainSilent/ExtractFileIcon

https://github.com/MainSilent/GetWindowsStoreApps
